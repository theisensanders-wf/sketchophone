#Quick Python Lesson
#This is where we declare methods or classes that can be called from the module name.
#for example
#If this file contained this:
import logging
def hello_world():
    logging.info('hello world')
# Then we could call this method by saying using this any where in the app
# import auth
# auth.hello_world()
# and the string hello world would be logged in the google app engine logger.

# i'm not sure what kind of methods or classes we should put in here
